# banman-lite-whitelist
A very simple plugin for whitelisting people on BeamMP servers based on my other plugin "banman-lite".

To install just move the main.lua file into Resources/Server/banman-lite-whitelist/. Whitelist file needs to be in the "banman-lite-whitelist" folder.

To add whitelisted users, just add the names to the whitelist on separate lines. Whitelist is case sensitive.
