# WhitelistManager
A simple plugin for whitelisting people on BeamMP servers based on my other plugin "banman".

To install just move the whitelistman folder into ```Resources/Server/``` Whitelist should be placed a directory up from the directory where the BeamMP-server executable is located.

Uses the same commands as BanMan except has no ban functionality. <br>
To whitelist people use ```/whitelist (username)``` on the server.
